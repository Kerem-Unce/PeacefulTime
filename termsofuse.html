                                By downloading or using the app, these terms will
                                automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore
                                that you read them carefully before using the app. You’re not
                                allowed to copy or modify the app, any part of the app, or
                                our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to
                                extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try
                                to translate the app into other languages or make derivative
                                versions. The app itself, and all the trademarks, copyright,
                                database rights, and other intellectual property rights related
                                to it, still belong to Emre Kochan.
                              </p> <p>
                                Emre Kochan is committed to ensuring that the app is
                                as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we
                                reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for
                                its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never
                                charge you for the app or its services without making it very
                                clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.

                                The Peaceful Time app stores and processes personal data that
                                you have provided to us, to provide my
                                Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and
                                access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do
                                not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of
                                removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the
                                official operating system of your device. It could make your
                                phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs,
                                compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean
                                that the Peaceful Time app won’t work properly or at all.

                                You should be aware that there are certain things that
                                Emre Kochan will not take responsibility for. Certain
                                functions of the app will require the app to have an active
                                internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi or provided
                                by your mobile network provider, but Emre Kochan
                                cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full
                                functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t
                                have any of your data allowance left.
                              </p> <p></p> <p>
                                If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you
                                should remember that the terms of the agreement with your
                                mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may
                                be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for
                                the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or
                                other third-party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting
                                responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data
                                charges if you use the app outside of your home territory
                                (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If
                                you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re
                                using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have
                                received permission from the bill payer for using the app.
                              </p> <p>
                                Along the same lines, Emre Kochan cannot always take
                                responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to
                                make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of
                                battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service,
                                Emre Kochan cannot accept responsibility.
                              </p> <p>
                                With respect to Emre Kochan’s responsibility for your
                                use of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s important to
                                bear in mind that although we endeavor to ensure that it is
                                updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties
                                to provide information to us so that we can make it available
                                to you. Emre Kochan accepts no liability for any
                                loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of
                                relying wholly on this functionality of the app.
                              </p> <p>
                                At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is
                                currently available on iOS – the requirements for the 
                                system(and for any additional systems we
                                decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change,
                                and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep
                                using the app. Emre Kochan does not promise that it
                                will always update the app so that it is relevant to you
                                and/or works with the iOS version that you have
                                installed on your device. However, you promise to always
                                accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may
                                also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of
                                it at any time without giving notice of termination to you.
                                Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the
                                rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end;
                                (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it
                                from your device.
